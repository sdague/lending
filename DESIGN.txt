There are two classes of users, lenders and librarians.

Lenders can
 * Request an item to lend
 * Delete an unfulfilled request
 * See who has requested an item, and who currently has the item

Librarians can
 * Check out an item that has been requested by a user - if it is not
 already checked out
 * Check out an item that has not been requested by a user - if it is
 not already checked out
 * Delete any request
 * Check in an item (i.e. it has been returned)

Librarians have access to a number of additional views:
 * All checked out items with the current owner.
 * All outstanding requests, grouped by item.
 * Past lending history.

A lender may have only one open request for an item.

Requests are sorted by creation time, those towards the top should
have priority.

Checkouts will be tracked, but only active ones displayed, this makes
undo or audit history easier.

Request:
 - rid - some id value
 - uid - the user
 - nid - the node
 - created_at - timestamp for creation
 - proccessed_at - timestamp for converting to checkout
 - deleted_at - timestamp for when this was deleted by the user
 - cid - the checkout id this was converted to

Checkouts
 - cid - some id value
 - uid - the user
 - nid - the node
 - created_at - timestamp for creation
 - created_lid - librarian that created the checkout
 - returned_at - timestamp for return
 - returned_lid - librarian that created the return
