== Configuration ==

After installation you will need to configure 2 things to see anything
with the Lending Library.

First go to the Lending Library administration
"admin/settings/lending" and mark which content types represent
lendable items.

Second, there are two permissions, use lending, and admin lending,
which you should assign to appropriate roles.
